            <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds</li>
            <li>Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time</li>
            <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph</li>
            <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes</li>
            <li>Pigeons are fed by many members of different religions including Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs for spiritual reasons</li>
            <li>Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc</li>
            <li>Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease</li>
            <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’</li>
