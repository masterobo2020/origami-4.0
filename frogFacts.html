            <li>There are over 5,000 species of frog</li>
            <li>Frogs don’t need to drink water as they absorb it through their skin</li>
            <li>A frog’s call is unique to its species, and some frog calls can be heard up to a mile away</li>
            <li>Some frogs can jump over 20 times their own body length; that is like a human jumping 30m</li>
            <li>Frogs can live in habitats as diverse as rain forests and deserts</li>
            <li>Asian tree frogs build nests in trees above water so that when the tadpoles hatch they fall directly into the water</li>
            <li>In Egypt the frog is the symbol of life and fertility, and in Egyptian mythology Heget is a frog-goddess who represents fertility</li>
            <li>Females of some frog species keep a regular check on their offspring (tadpoles) and if food becomes scarce she will deposit unfertilised eggs for them to eat</li>
